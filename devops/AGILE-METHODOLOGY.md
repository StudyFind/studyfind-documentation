# Agile Methodology

## Sprints

*1 month long*

### Meetings

* Sprint Planning: First meeting - as long as it takes to do the following:

  1. Assiging any new issues added since the last meeting effort, value and important points

     A. Members (secretly) assign each issue effort and value points
     B. Effort and value points are then averaged and rounded to the nearest integer and the final values are added to the issue description
     C. Find the issue `importance = 10 * (rounded average value points / rounded average effort points)` (should be a number between 1 and 100)

  2. Pick from existing issues by prioritizing the importance score
  3. Sprints should target having a total of 8 story points per team member (a team of 6 should target tackling issues with a total of 48 story points)
