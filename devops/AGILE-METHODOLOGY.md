## Meetings

### Sprint Planning

*First meeting of the sprint (as long as it takes)*

1. Assign effort, value, and important points to any new issues added since the last sprint planning meeting

   1. Members secretly assign each issue effort and value points on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the easiest/smallest and 10 being the hardest/greatest
   2. Effort and value points are then averaged and rounded to the nearest integer and the final values are added to the issue description
   3. Calculate the issue's `importance = 10 * (rounded average value points / rounded average effort points)` (should be a number between 1 and 100)

2. Pick from existing issues by prioritizing the importance score (most important issues get picked first)
3. Sprints should target having a total of 8 story points per team member (a team of 6 should target tackling issues with a total of 48 story points)
4. Requirements should be defined in selected issue descriptions in as much detail as possible
