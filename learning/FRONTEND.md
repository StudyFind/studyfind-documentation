## Independent Project Requirements

#### Personal Website

The project is to build a personal website with three pages using all the concepts you have learned.

1. Home: This page include a picture of you along with a short bio and anything else you want to highlight
2. About: This page includes a list of projects you have built along with bulleted descriptions
3. Contact: This contains a contact form which visitors can fill out if they want to contact you (the form doesnâ€™t need to actually work on the backend since the courses only cover HTML and CSS - instead you can simply `console.log` the input values when the button is clicked). This would include inputs for name and message and a button to submit the form.

Use all the concepts you have learned including and not limited to:

* Internal links
* External links
* Inputs
* Buttons
* Images
* Flex elements
* Grid elements

#### Todo List App

1. Add tasks to list
2. Add deadline for each task
3. Check off tasks
4. Sort tasks by name
5. Sort tasks by deadline
6. Toggle visibility of completed tasks
7. Filter tasks by day
