# Sample Web Scraping Project

## Objective

Create a web scraping project to extract information about organizations from ProPublica.
Use both BeautifulSoup AND Selenium to complete this task. It will allow you to explore two methods of webscraping, both of which have different uses. 

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- BeautifulSoup/Selenium

## Given

(nonprofits.txt)
You are provided with a file containing 1,000 entries detailing nonprofit ID, the name of the nonprofit, and its location. An example entry is as follows:

```plaintext
000004101|South Lafourche Quarterback Club|Lockport|LA|United States|PF
```

(sample-project.py)
You are also given template code to begin your project.

## Set Up Your Project:

1. **Create a new Python script for your project.**
   - Install the necessary libraries (requests and beautifulsoup4) using a virtual environment.

2. **Write a Function to Extract Information:**
   - Create a function that takes the URL of an organization's page as input and returns a list containing the extracted information.
   - Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract relevant data.

3. **Handle Different Cases:**
   - Account for situations where the information may not be available or is not structured as expected.
   - Implement error handling to gracefully handle exceptions.

4. **Scrape Multiple Pages:**
   - Write a loop to scrape information from multiple organization pages.
   - Consider adding a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming the server.

5. **Store the Data:**
   - Choose a storage format for your data (e.g., CSV).
   - Write the extracted information to a file for further analysis.

6. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test your scraper on a small subset of pages to ensure it works as expected.
   - Refine your code as needed and handle edge cases.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Add comments to explain your code.
   - Write a brief documentation or readme file that describes how to use your scraper.
